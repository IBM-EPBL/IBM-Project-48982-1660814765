     The project aims to develop a system that converts the sign language into a human 
     hearing voice in the desired language to convey a message to normal people, 
     as well as convert speech into understandable sign language for the deaf and dumb.
     We are making use of a convolution neural network to create a model that is trained 
     on different hand gestures. An app is built which uses this model. 
     This app enables deaf and dumb people to convey their information using signs which 
     get converted to human-understandable language and speech is given as output
